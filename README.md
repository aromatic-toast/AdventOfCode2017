Advent of Code 2017 Coding Challenges

Advent of Code is created by Eric Wastl. It is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved with any programming lanugage. I chose to use the R programming language for these puzzles. 

Each code file contains the description of the puzzle to be solved along with accompanying code.
